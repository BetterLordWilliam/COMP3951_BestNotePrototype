# Hello World!
This is my essay about why I think Mr. Will Otterbein is the coolest guy this side of sliced bread.
Now, I know what you are thinking, "Wow, what an awful start to a paper on fundamental theories of computer science." You would be correct.

Many eons ago, when I was a small child -- smaller than I am currently that is to say -- I went for a stroll when I suddenly came across a strange man wearing strange clothes with a particularily strange hairsty-.

Oh yeah, computer science.
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	System.out.println("Bryson has been cooking!");
}
```

## Time efficiency analysis of that last thing
| Algorithm Name | Algorithm Happiness Status | Programmer Happiness Status | Effeciency |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Who cares | Very, it is fast! | Not very, he made it fast | O(-2) |
| Monkey Sort | Tricks list items to order with banana | Quite, he was a fan of bananas | O(62^420) |

*Footnote, none of the information presented above is accurate*

Btw, I think you are a chill guy... üòé

Hello dear friends, family and viewers, longtime viewers specifically I only care about how much money you have given me.

 I regret to inform you that I have come under fire in recent days for my viral use of the PH-word. Yes, I am afraid that the far centrist mob is trying to cancel me just for speaking freely, as any man should have the right to do -- to clarify for those who are unware about what the PH-word is, I called someone basic (ü•Å) -- You could say that the response has been... acidic ‚öóÔ∏è... (ü•Å).

My fellow bramericans, we need to stand together to rize against the tyranny or something.

You get the picture. Your's not so truly.
